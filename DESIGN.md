# The Awakened — Design Decisions

This document records the rule conflicts and missing decisions found in the
original design brief, the temporary/simple rule chosen for each, and the
concrete balance numbers used by the first prototype. Everything here is
deliberately simple and easy to change later — see "Flexibility notes" at
the end.

## 1. Conflicts / gaps found, and resolutions

### 1.1 What "turn" means for status timing
The brief says players take alternating turns, but also says Burn triggers
"at the beginning of the affected hero's turn." Heroes don't have individual
turns — players do, and a player's turn covers all of their heroes at once.

**Decision:** "hero's turn" = "that hero's controlling player's turn."
Start-of-turn effects (Burn, etc.) for a player resolve once, at the start
of that player's turn, for every one of that player's heroes that has the
status.

### 1.2 Energy pool scope
**Decision:** Energy is a single pool per *player* per turn (not per hero),
matching "players begin each turn with 3 energy" and the shared action deck.
Any card in hand can be played against its cost regardless of which of the
player's heroes it belongs to, as long as that hero is alive.

### 1.3 Hand/discard cycling
The brief doesn't say whether unused hand cards persist between a player's
own turns (with an opponent turn in between).

**Decision (Slay the Spire style):** At end of a player's turn, all cards
remaining in hand are discarded. At the start of a player's next turn, they
draw back up to a fresh hand of 5 from their draw pile (reshuffling discard
into draw if the draw pile runs out).

### 1.4 Deck size / copies per card
Six unique card types per player (3 heroes × 2 cards) is too small a pool
for a 5-card hand to feel like a real deck.

**Decision:** Each hero's Attack and Ability card is included as **3
copies** in the player's deck, giving an 18-card deck (3 heroes × 2 cards ×
3 copies). Team-Up cards are *not* part of the draw deck (see 1.7).

### 1.5 Which player acts first
No randomness is allowed in combat, but turn order needs a decision.

**Decision:** Player 1 always acts first in the prototype. This is a
placeholder — swapping to alternating first-player or a coin flip is a
one-line change (`src/engine/match.ts`).

### 1.6 Defeated hero's cards still in deck/hand
**Decision:** When a hero is defeated, any of their cards remaining in the
draw pile, discard pile, or the player's current hand are immediately and
permanently removed. This keeps the "defeated heroes cannot act" rule
airtight without needing a per-card "is this hero alive" check at play
time (that check still exists as a safety net).

### 1.7 How Team-Up cards become playable
Team-Up cards aren't drawn — the brief says they should be clearly visible
as available once unlocked.

**Decision:** Team-Up cards live outside the draw/discard cycle, as a
separate always-visible list. As soon as both required heroes are alive
**and** both are on the player's selected team, the Team-Up card appears as
playable (cost 3 energy, once per match). It's removed permanently once
played, or if either required hero is defeated.

### 1.8 Status effect duration & stacking (Burn / Wet / Shield)
Needed explicit, deterministic numbers.

**Decision:**
- **Burn**: a duration counter, not a stack counter. Applying Burn to a
  target sets/refreshes its remaining triggers to **2** (re-applying does
  *not* add extra instances — it just refreshes back to 2). At the start of
  the affected hero's controller's turn, Burn deals its fixed damage once
  and its remaining-triggers counter decrements by 1; at 0 it's removed.
- **Wet**: a simple boolean flag, no expiry timer. It is only removed when
  a Lightning card consumes it for the bonus-damage interaction (or when
  the hero is defeated). Re-applying Wet to an already-Wet target is a
  no-op.
- **Shield**: a single numeric pool per hero that absorbs damage before HP.
  It does not decay over time. Applying more Shield adds to the existing
  amount (no cap in the prototype).

### 1.9 Execute's "defined health threshold"
**Decision:** "Below a defined health threshold" = **≤ 30% of the target's
max HP**.

### 1.10 Shadow Assassin's "reduced damage" on first attack taken
**Decision:** The first instance of damage taken by Shadow Assassin each
match is reduced by a **flat 3**, to a minimum of 1 damage.

### 1.11 Chain Spark targeting ("one target... another enemy")
**Decision:** The player explicitly chooses both targets (primary and
secondary), which must be two different enemy heroes. If the enemy team
only has one hero left alive, Chain Spark's secondary hit is skipped (no
valid second target) and only the primary hit resolves.

### 1.12 Team-Up resolution order
Both Team-Up cards list multiple effects; the interface must show the
order explicitly. Decided orders (also enforced by the engine as an
ordered event list):

- **Steam Surge** (Fire Mage + Water Healer): 1) deal fixed damage to all
  enemies → 2) remove Wet from any enemy that had it → 3) apply Burn to all
  enemies.
- **Thunder Tide** (Water Healer + Lightning Duelist): 1) apply Wet to all
  enemies → 2) deal Lightning damage to each enemy, consuming the
  just-applied Wet for the bonus (so every enemy takes the Wet-bonus
  amount) → 3) remove Wet from all enemies hit.

### 1.13 Simultaneous / tie resolution
The engine only ever applies one player's action at a time and re-checks
victory after every single event, so simultaneous double-defeats can't
occur — there is always a well-defined event order. No extra rule needed.

### 1.14 Hero selection secrecy for a local prototype
True network secrecy isn't available in a single-machine prototype.

**Decision:** Hot-seat flow — Player 1 picks 3 of 5 heroes on a "pass the
device" screen, then Player 2 does the same on a fresh screen that hides
Player 1's picks, then both are revealed together. This preserves the
"simultaneous reveal" feel without networking, and is isolated in one
component so it can be swapped for real simultaneous online selection
later without touching the engine.

## 2. Balance numbers (prototype values, all fixed/deterministic)

| Hero | Role | Element | Max HP | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire Mage | Mage | Fire | 18 | |
| Earth Guardian | Defender | Earth | 24 | starts with 4 Shield |
| Water Healer | Support | Water | 20 | |
| Lightning Duelist | Fighter | Lightning | 20 | |
| Shadow Assassin | Assassin | Shadow | 16 | first hit taken reduced by 3 |

| Card | Hero | Cost | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fire Bolt (attack) | Fire Mage | 1 | 5 dmg to one enemy + apply Burn (2 triggers, 3 dmg each) |
| Flame Wave (ability) | Fire Mage | 2 | 3 dmg to all enemies |
| Stone Strike (attack) | Earth Guardian | 1 | 5 dmg to one enemy |
| Fortify (ability) | Earth Guardian | 2 | +6 Shield to one ally |
| Tidal Shot (attack) | Water Healer | 1 | 3 dmg to one enemy + apply Wet |
| Restoring Current (ability) | Water Healer | 2 | heal 6 (7 if first heal this match) to one ally |
| Charged Slash (attack) | Lightning Duelist | 1 | 5 dmg; if target Wet, +3 bonus dmg and remove Wet |
| Chain Spark (ability) | Lightning Duelist | 2 | 4 dmg to primary target, 2 dmg to secondary target; each gets +3/removes Wet independently if Wet |
| Quick Strike (attack) | Shadow Assassin | 1 | 5 dmg to one enemy |
| Execute (ability) | Shadow Assassin | 2 | 4 dmg; +6 bonus dmg if target ≤ 30% max HP |

Passives:
- **Fire Mage**: +1 damage dealt by this hero to any target that currently has Burn.
- **Earth Guardian**: begins the match with 4 Shield.
- **Water Healer**: the first healing card *this player* uses each match heals +1 additional.
- **Lightning Duelist**: whenever this hero's card consumes Wet for the bonus-damage interaction, this hero gains 2 Shield.
- **Shadow Assassin**: the first damage instance taken by this hero each match is reduced by 3 (min 1).

Team-Up cards:
- **Steam Surge** (Fire Mage + Water Healer, cost 3): 6 dmg to all enemies → remove Wet from any hit → apply Burn (2 triggers, 3 dmg) to all enemies.
- **Thunder Tide** (Water Healer + Lightning Duelist, cost 3): apply Wet to all enemies → deal 4 dmg + 3 Wet bonus (7 total) to each enemy, consuming Wet.

Deck: 3 copies each of a hero's Attack and Ability card → 18 cards per
player. Hand size 5, draw/discard/reshuffle as in section 1.3.

## 3. Flexibility notes (for future work, not built yet)

- Turn system is isolated behind `src/engine/turn.ts` so alternating turns
  can later be replaced with simultaneous planning without touching
  damage/status/target-validation code.
- All engine functions are pure and return an ordered `GameEvent[]` list;
  the renderer/animation layer only ever reads events, never mutates game
  state directly.
- Ultimates, more elements, more heroes, and more Team-Ups are intentionally
  left out of this prototype per the brief.
